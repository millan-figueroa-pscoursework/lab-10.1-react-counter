# React Counter with useEffect

## Scenario

You have been tasked to build an advanced counter application. This project will challenge you to go beyond simple state updates by requiring you to manage multiple state dependencies, implement side effects using the useEffect hook (including proper cleanup), and handle more complex state update logic. The goal is to solidify your understanding of useState and useEffect in a practical context, focusing on how they work together to create interactive and responsive components.

## Learning Objectives

Upon successful completion of this lab, you will be able to:<br>

Implement and manage multiple pieces of state within a single component using useState.
Utilize the useEffect hook to perform side effects in response to state changes.
Implement proper cleanup functions within useEffect to prevent memory leaks or unexpected behavior.
Write state update logic that correctly handles dependencies and previous state.
Apply your knowledge to build a feature-rich counter with history tracking, auto-save, keyboard interactions, and a reset mechanism.
